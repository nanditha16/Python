# Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

# Symbol       Value
# I             1
# V             5
# X             10
# L             50
# C             100
# D             500
# M             1000
# For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two ones added together.
#  12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.

# Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. 
# However, the numeral for four is not IIII. 
# Instead, the number four is written as IV. 
# Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four.
#  The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:
    # I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
    # X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
    # C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
    # Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer. Constraints:

# 1 <= s.length <= 15
# s contains only the characters ('I', 'V', 'X', 'L', 'C', 'D', 'M').
# It is guaranteed that s is a valid roman numeral in the range [1, 3999].

# Mapping: Each Roman numeral character is mapped to its integer value.
# Reverse Traversal: We iterate from right to left so we can easily detect subtraction cases (like IV or IX).
# Subtraction Rule: If a numeral is smaller than the one after it (in original order), subtract it. Otherwise, add it.

class Solution:
    def romanToInt(self, s: str) -> int:
        roman_map = {
            'I': 1, 'V': 5, 'X': 10, 'L': 50,
            'C': 100, 'D': 500, 'M': 1000
        }

        total = 0
        prev_value = 0

        for char in reversed(s):
            value = roman_map[char]
            if value < prev_value:
                total -= value
            else:
                total += value
            prev_value = value

        return total
